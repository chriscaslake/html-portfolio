 <h1>The Best Movies According to Me!</h1>
 <h2> My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr/>

<h3>Tucker and Dale vs Evil</h3>
<p>Hilarious horror comedy, hits the nail on the head.</p>

<h3>Sonic 1</h3>
<p>I don't know why but it was the first movie I thought of, after Tucker.</p>

<h3>Sonic 2</h3>
<p>Makes sense doesn't it? I said #1 so now I had to say #2</p>
